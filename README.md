# Stopwatch-App

My first independent Javascript Project outside of school

This is a small project but still a very huge step towards improvement for me.


Now I placed a script right before my javascript file which is called 'HackTimer.js'.
This script wasn't written by me, but was used to make sure the stopwatch is still
running correctly even after switching to another tab or minimizing your browser.
for more info about this script go here https://github.com/turuslan/HackTimer.

Now I hope This works for whoever you are and thanks for coming.
